<h1>Files</h1>
<p>SpigotGUI Remastered contains a file explorer and editor.</p>
<br>

<h2>Using the explorer</h2>
<p>The explorer was created to be used for managing the server files.</p>
<p>To edit a file, you may double click a file and it'll open the editor.</p>
<p>Files that start with a slash is a directory which you can go into by double clicking it.</p>
<p>You can move up a directory by double clicking "..".</p>
<br>

<ul>
	<li>New</li>
	<li>Open</li>
	<li>Save</li>
</ul>
<p>They do what you'd think they do.</p>
